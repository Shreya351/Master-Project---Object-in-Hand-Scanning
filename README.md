**Abstract:**


Accurate 3D models play an important part in Robotic applications. It is a crucial requirement for achieving precise object manipulation and robust perception tasks. This report details core methodologies necessary for Surface reconstruction. The core concept of this project is the process that is required to convert raw sensor data into a coherent 3D mesh model. The goal is to achieve an accurate 3D model of an object placed in a Robot gripper. This process starts with data acquisition through a stereo camera integrated with ROS framework. These stereo images are then used to generate dense Point Clouds. This conversion is essential for the subsequent pre-processing steps and providing necessary input for surface reconstruction. The processed point clouds are then used to generate the 3D mesh. The resultant 3D mesh can be used for other robotic applications that require accurate spatial information thereby promoting precise gripping and improved decision making capabilities.
